Currently I'm a PhD candidate in the TSIC within Telematics Architecture and Engineering department at the Polytechnic University of Madrid (UPM) and PhD candidate in the Medical Sensors, Signals and Systems Research Group at KTH (Sweden). Before joining TSIC in September 2011, I took part in a research user-centered projects at University of Alcala (UAH). Since 2013 I'm making use of my research within MSSS-KTH to improve the acceptance of telemedicine solutions deployed in real homes.

During my engineering degree in the UAH (Spain) I have worked to several projects oriented to web and the Human-System interaction (directed to handicapped people). My research lines are centered in HCI and proactive systems from Ubicomp and Physical Computing point of view.

Specializations: HCI and Intelligent User Interface, Ambient intelligence, Ubiquitous Computing, e-Health and AAL.
